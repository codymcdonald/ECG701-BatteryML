# Battery RUL Prediction Models

This document describes the machine learning models used for battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, including their parameters and characteristics.

## Models Overview

### 1. Random Forest
**Description**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mean prediction of individual trees.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'random_state': 42
}
```

**Pros**:
- Handles both numerical and categorical features well
- Robust to outliers and noise
- Provides feature importance scores
- Less prone to overfitting than single decision trees
- Works well with high-dimensional data

**Cons**:
- Can be memory intensive with large datasets
- Slower training time compared to simpler models
- Less interpretable than single decision trees

### 2. Gradient Boosting
**Description**: An ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.3],
    'max_depth': [3, 5],
    'random_state': 42
}
```

**Pros**:
- Often achieves better accuracy than Random Forest
- Handles mixed data types well
- Provides feature importance
- Can handle missing values

**Cons**:
- More prone to overfitting than Random Forest
- Requires careful tuning of learning rate
- Slower training time
- Sensitive to outliers

### 3. AdaBoost
**Description**: An adaptive boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners into a strong learner.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.5, 1.0],
    'random_state': 42
}
```

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- Less prone to overfitting
- Works well with weak learners
- Can handle both classification and regression

**Cons**:
- Sensitive to noisy data and outliers
- Performance depends heavily on the base estimator
- Can be slow with large datasets

### 4. Linear Regression
**Description**: A simple linear model that assumes a linear relationship between features and target.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'fit_intercept': [True, False],
    'normalize': [True, False]
}
```

**Pros**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast training and prediction
- Works well when relationships are linear
- Low computational cost

**Cons**:
- Assumes linear relationships
- Sensitive to outliers
- Cannot capture complex patterns
- Requires feature scaling

### 5. Ridge Regression
**Description**: Linear regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'alpha': [0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
    'fit_intercept': [True, False],
    'normalize': [True, False]
}
```

**Pros**:
- Reduces overfitting
- Works well with multicollinearity
- More stable than standard linear regression
- Handles high-dimensional data better

**Cons**:
- All features are kept (no feature selection)
- Requires tuning of alpha parameter
- Still assumes linear relationships

### 6. Lasso Regression
**Description**: Linear regression with L1 regularization that can perform feature selection.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'alpha': [0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
    'fit_intercept': [True, False],
    'normalize': [True, False]
}
```

**Pros**:
- Performs feature selection
- Handles multicollinearity
- Produces sparse solutions
- Good for high-dimensional data

**Cons**:
- Tends to select only one feature from correlated groups
- Requires careful tuning of alpha
- May underperform with highly correlated features

### 7. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
**Description**: Uses support vector machines for regression tasks, finding a hyperplane that best fits the data.

**Parameters Used**:
```python
{
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly'],
    'C': [0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
    'epsilon': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto']
}
```

**Pros**:
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Robust to outliers
- Works well with non-linear relationships
- Memory efficient

**Cons**:
- Requires careful parameter tuning
- Can be slow with large datasets
- Difficult to interpret
- Sensitive to feature scaling

## Model Selection Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Linear Regression or Ridge Regression to establish a baseline
2. **Feature Importance**: Use Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to understand feature importance
3. **Non-linear Relationships**: Consider SVR or ensemble methods if relationships are non-linear
4. **Computational Resources**: Consider training time and memory requirements
5. **Interpretability**: Choose simpler models if interpretability is important
6. **Data Size**: Consider model scalability for large datasets
7. **Regularization**: Use Ridge or Lasso if dealing with multicollinearity

## Best Practices

1. Always perform feature scaling before training
2. Use cross-validation for parameter tuning
3. Monitor training time vs. performance
4. Consider ensemble methods for better accuracy
5. Regularize models to prevent overfitting
6. Validate assumptions about data distribution
7. Document model performance metrics
